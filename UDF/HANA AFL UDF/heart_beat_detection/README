                --- Very Quick SDK Start Guide ---
                ----------------------------------

1) Create a $HANA_SDK_PATH environment variable with the path where the SDK
   is located.

2) Add the $HANA_SDK_PATH/tools directory to your $PATH.

3) Write your AFL inside a development directory.

    3.1) Look at afl_intro.afx, intro.h, and intro.cpp for an overview of the
    technology.

4) Build the code: aflmake <AFL_NAME>

    4.1) The aflmake is an exemplary script that performs all necessary steps
         to construct a shared library that is compliant with the AFL
         framework. It is recommended that you use it as a reference in order
         to customize your own build environment.

    4.2) For the intro dema run: aflmake intro

5) Write a manifest file.

    5.1) Copy $HANA_SDK_PATH/tools/manifest_template to the development
         directory, rename it to manifest, and replace the following variables
         accordingly.

         - ${HANA_SDK_VENDOR_NAME}: Vendor name in lower case letters (no spaces
                                    or special characters).
         - ${HANA_SDK_AFL_NAME}: AFL name in lower case letters (no spaces or
                                 special characters, except underscores).
         - ${HANA_SDK_AFL_CAPTION}: One line description of the AFL.

    5.2) Look at $HANA_SDK_PATH/demos/intro/manifest for an example.

6) Prepare the directory structure in your HANA server.

    6.1) Got to /hana/shared/<SID>/exe/linuxx86_64/ and create a sub-directory
         named
         ${HANA_SDK_VENDOR_NAME}_afl_sdk_${HANA_SDK_AFL_NAME}_1.00.1.0.0_1
         with variables replaced as mentioned above.

    6.2) Change to directory $DIR_SYSEXE/plugins/ (create it, if it does not
         exist) and create a softlink named
         ${HANA_SDK_VENDOR_NAME}_afl_sdk_${HANA_SDK_AFL_NAME}
         pointing to the physical directory created in the previous step.

7) Deploy the AFL: afldeploy <AFL_NAME> <SYS_ID> <INSTANCE_NUM> <HOST>

    7.1) In order to invoke "variable columns" AFs it is necessary to have an
         an auxiliary procedure generator in the catalog (also one for one its
         removal). You can find them in the $HANA_SDK_PATH/tools directory under
         the names afl_wrapper_generator.sql and afl_wrapper_eraser.sql.

    7.2) Remember to enable the scriptserver.
